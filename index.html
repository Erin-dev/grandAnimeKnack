<h2> Black people can have a role in Anime </h2>
<p> Black people are innovative and great to say the least, anime with elements of black culture is a future awaiting. It’ll be fresh and it’s not partially inconceivable. The animes Afro Samurai and Samurai Champloo are prominent examples. It won’t stop there because black people are well on their way negotiating and even creating their own anime. Something this spectacular is long overdue like specifically through a little over a decade. No time for procrastination, an anime like that is in the works!
