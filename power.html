<h2> A feature on African Americans inspired by Anime </h2>
<p> My paragraph will begin with an African American female that shows her interest in anime through her accomplishments. I’ll put in the strive for black people who love anime that their efforts will open a path for non- Japanese to even make incredible anime series.
    The great genres of anime need better representation of black people especially during this generation. The world is big, but became smaller in a way due to technology so stereotypes shouldn’t be prominent or at least there should be more representation. </p>
